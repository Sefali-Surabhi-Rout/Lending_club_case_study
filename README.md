## General Information
- This is a case study on Lending Club.
- Lending Club is a marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers who are seeking a loan with investors looking to lend money and make a return. 
- The goal here is to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. We can utilize this knowledge for portfolio and risk assessment. 
- The dataset used here contains the complete loan data for all loans issued by Lending Club through the time period 2007 to 2011.


## Conclusions
- We used EDA to understand how costumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.
